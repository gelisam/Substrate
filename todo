Todo now

Story 10: I can save the current project. Use a version number in case the
          format changes.
Story 11: I can run the script with a particular file as input.
Story 12: I can run the script with each file from a directory (recursively)
          as input.
Story 13: I can run the script with only the changed files as input.
Story 14: I can perform story 13 from the command line, or when a file change
          is detected.
Story 15: I can write multiple parallel scripts (all with the same input).
Story 16: I can write multiple sequential scripts (feeding one into the other).
Story 17: I can reload and run the entire project.
Story 18: Simple filesystem-backed key-value store with one file per key.
Story 19: The project reloads when the filesystem copy of the store changes.
Story 20: Specialized store interface for strings, integers, and string arrays.
Story 21: The project stores the active input tab.


Above are the tasks which are planned for the current iteration,
plus a few more.

- Without dataStore.clear(), removing an input won't delete it on disk.
- Which error message do you get if the script file doesn't exist?
- Stores clobber their data if reload fails.
- Erasing keys won't remove files.
- Same hotkey for Open and Reloadx
- Edit field1 in the UI, edit field2 on disk, field1 gets clobbered.
- QFileSystemWatcher error messages when saving.

feature request:

And here are the bugs and feature requests found in or inspired by past
iterations. Things that might be worth doing some day, but not right now.

bugs:
- Memory leak? Make sure closing tabs (through loading) deletes them.
- When saving, it's hard to select (and overwrite) an existing directory.
- Null pointer? currentInputEditor may return null if all panes are closed.
- build.sh now creates stable.app and generated.app instead of substrate.app
- wrapped-around lines break truncated execution
- Down key always moves cursor to first character of the line.
- Can't move below a line which wraps around using the Down key.
- Enter key always scrolls to the top.
- Even with "All files" selected, File/Open cannot open the file "myscript".

feature request:
- pwd should be the .sub's parent folder
- truncate inside variable definitions
- truncate after first iteration of a loop
- An easy way to clobber the files generated by build.sh
- Folder-processing instead of text-processing
- Ability to execute any portion of a script, not just top-to-current-line
- Ability to bypass part of a script
- Remember the window geometry from last session
- Open source files in vim
- Easily diff folders, ignoring generated files
- Easily diff output with manually-typed target text
- Easily select/ignore regions delimited by top-level braces
- Remember last open file
- Easily wrap text around existing text.
- Easy way to select up to or from a particular line.
- Save the output to a calculated filename.
- Easy way to indent a block of text.
- Easy way to add and subtract integers.
- Show the result inside the app, so we can prevent scrolling to the end.
- Easy way to strip newlines from the beginning.
- Use "clear" instead of "echo '==='" in the demo.
- Easy way to write text with substitutions, repeating "echo" is cumbersome.
- Easy way to diff with some manually-written target text.
- Maybe Ctrl-R instead of F5? Something closer to the home key.
- Could pressing End go to the end of the line, not the end of the script?
- Cache sub-results for long scripts
- Don't blank the output until the new output is completely computed
- A cancel button if the script loops
- A mechanism to enter special ASCII characters
- A variant of sed which works through newlines
- An easy way to run the truncated text + some post-processing
