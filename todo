Todo now
===

- Setup continuous compilation (using Substrate to detect when the source
  files change).
- Use signals to propagate errors.
- Implement an InputNode which can bake itself.
- Implement a Gui which links the input nodes with the input pane widget.

Above are the tasks which are planned for the current iteration.

And here are the bugs and feature requests found in or inspired by past
iterations. Things that might be worth doing some day, but not right now.

bugs:
- Memory leak? Make sure closing tabs (through loading) deletes them.
- When saving, it's hard to select (and overwrite) an existing directory.
- Null pointer? currentInputEditor may return null if all panes are closed.
- build.sh now creates stable.app and generated.app instead of substrate.app
- wrapped-around lines break truncated execution
- Down key always moves cursor to first character of the line.
- Can't move below a line which wraps around using the Down key.
- Enter key always scrolls to the top.
- Even with "All files" selected, File/Open cannot open the file "myscript".
- The application starts in the background.
- Unknown error when trying to save the default project.
- Without dataStore.clear(), removing an input won't delete it on disk.
- Which error message do you get if the script file doesn't exist?
- Stores clobber their data if reload fails.
- Erasing keys won't remove files.
- Same hotkey for Open and Reloadx
- Edit field1 in the UI, edit field2 on disk, field1 gets clobbered.
- QFileSystemWatcher error messages when saving.

feature request:
- pwd should be the .sub's parent folder
- truncate inside variable definitions
- truncate after first iteration of a loop
- An easy way to clobber the files generated by build.sh
- Folder-processing instead of text-processing
- Ability to execute any portion of a script, not just top-to-current-line
- Ability to bypass part of a script
- Remember the window geometry from last session
- Open source files in vim
- Easily diff folders, ignoring generated files
- Easily diff output with manually-typed target text
- Easily select/ignore regions delimited by top-level braces
- Remember last open file
- Easily wrap text around existing text.
- Easy way to select up to or from a particular line.
- Save the output to a calculated filename.
- Easy way to indent a block of text.
- Easy way to add and subtract integers.
- Show the result inside the app, so we can prevent scrolling to the end.
- Easy way to strip newlines from the beginning.
- Use "clear" instead of "echo '==='" in the demo.
- Easy way to write text with substitutions, repeating "echo" is cumbersome.
- Easy way to diff with some manually-written target text.
- Maybe Ctrl-R instead of F5? Something closer to the home key.
- Could pressing End go to the end of the line, not the end of the script?
- Cache sub-results for long scripts
- Don't blank the output until the new output is completely computed
- A cancel button if the script loops
- A mechanism to enter special ASCII characters
- A variant of sed which works through newlines
- An easy way to run the truncated text + some post-processing
- Don't auto-save if the data isn't dirty.


The flower and the pot

Here are the good and bad stories from past iterations. Let's figure out what
the good ones have in common and schedule more of those.

entertaining stories:
- Story 20: Specialized store interface for strings, integers, and arrays.

annoying stories:
- Story 19: The project reloads when the filesystem copy of the store changes.
