Above are the tasks which are planned for the current iteration, plus a few more.

Here are the bugs and feature requests found in or inspired by the current iteration.

bugs:
- Memory leak? Make sure closing tabs (through loading) deletes them.
- When saving, it's hard to select (and overwrite) an existing directory.
- Null pointer? currentInputEditor may return null if all panes are closed.
- build.sh now creates stable.app and generated.app instead of substrate.app
- wrapped-around lines break truncated execution

feature request:
- pwd should be the .sub's parent folder
- truncate inside variable definitions
- truncate after first iteration of a loop
- File/Save (please?)
- An easy way to clobber the files generated by build.sh
- Folder-processing instead of text-processing
- Ability to execute any portion of a script, not just top-to-current-line
- Ability to bypass part of a script
- Remember the window geometry from last session
- Open source files in vim
- Easily diff folders, ignoring generated files
- Easily diff output with manually-typed target text
- Easily select/ignore regions delimited by top-level braces
- Remember last open file
- Easily wrap text around existing text.
- Easy way to select up to or from a particular line.
- Save the output to a calculated filename.
- Easy way to indent a block of text.
- Easy way to add and subtract integers.
- Show the result inside the app, so we can prevent scrolling to the end.
- Easy way to strip newlines from the beginning.


Todo later

And here are the bugs and feature requests found in or inspired by past iterations.
Things that might be worth doing some day, but not right now.

bugs:
- Down key always moves cursor to first character of the line.
- Can't move below a line which wraps around using the Down key.
- Enter key always scrolls to the top.
- Even with "All files" selected, File/Open cannot open the file "myscript".

feature request:
- Use "clear" instead of "echo '==='" in the demo.
- Easy way to write text with substitutions, repeating "echo" is cumbersome.
- Easy way to diff with some manually-written target text.
- Maybe Ctrl-R instead of F5? Something closer to the home key.
- Could pressing End go to the end of the line, not the end of the script?
- Cache sub-results for long scripts
- Don't blank the output until the new output is completely computed
- A cancel button if the script loops
- A mechanism to enter special ASCII characters
- A variant of sed which works through newlines
- An easy way to run the truncated text + some post-processing
