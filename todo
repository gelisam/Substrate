Todo now

And here are the tasks which are planned for the next iteration and a half.
(Planning for exactly one iteration is dumb: by how much do you adjust your
velocity if you finish early?)

Story 5: I can enter different inputs for the script.
Story 6: I can run the script on a series of different inputs.
Story 7: I can save the script and its inputs as a single project.
---
Story 8: I can write multiple scripts which call each other.
Story 9: I can write a script which applies multiple inputs to another script.


Todo later

Here are the bugs and feature requests found in or inspired by past iterations.
Things that might be worth doing some day, but not right now.

bugs:
- Down key always moves cursor to first character of the line.
- Can't move below a line which wraps around using the Down key.
- Enter key always scrolls to the top.
- Even with "All files" selected, File/Open cannot open the file "myscript".

feature request:
- Use "clear" instead of "echo '==='" in the demo.
- Easy way to write text with substitutions, repeating "echo" is cumbersome.
- Easy way to diff with some manually-written target text.
- Maybe Ctrl-R instead of F5? Something closer to the home key.
- Could pressing End go to the end of the line, not the end of the script?
- Cache sub-results for long scripts
- Don't blank the output until the new output is completely computed
- A cancel button if the script loops
- A mechanism to enter special ASCII characters
- A variant of sed which works through newlines
- An easy way to run the truncated text + some post-processing
