And here are the bugs and feature requests found in or inspired by past iterations.
Things that might be worth doing some day, but not right now.

bugs:
- Down key always moves cursor to first character of the line.
- Can't move below a line which wraps around using the Down key.
- Enter key always scrolls to the top.
- Even with "All files" selected, File/Open cannot open the file "myscript".

feature request:
- Use "clear" instead of "echo '==='" in the demo.
- Easy way to write text with substitutions, repeating "echo" is cumbersome.
- Easy way to diff with some manually-written target text.
- Maybe Ctrl-R instead of F5? Something closer to the home key.
- Could pressing End go to the end of the line, not the end of the script?
- Cache sub-results for long scripts
- Don't blank the output until the new output is completely computed
- A cancel button if the script loops
- A mechanism to enter special ASCII characters
- A variant of sed which works through newlines
- An easy way to run the truncated text + some post-processing
