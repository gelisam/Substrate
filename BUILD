How to Build on Windows
---
First, download and install Qt.
This will install, among other things, a build tool called "qmake".

Open a DOS terminal, go to the Substrate directory and type "qmake". This
will create a build file appropriate for your platform, such as a Makefile for
UNIX systems or a Visual Studio project file for Windows. You should then be
able to compile the project using your platform's standard build tools.
