How to Build
===

First, download and install Qt 4.7.1 (other versions may also work, but haven't
been tested). This will install, among other things, a build tool called
"qmake".

If you are using OS X, just run "./run.sh" an enjoy Substrate.
If you are using Linux, just run "./build.sh" and enjoy Substrate.

Otherwise, open a shell, go to the current directory and type "qmake". This
will create a build file appropriate for your platform, such as a Makefile for
UNIX systems or a Visual Studio project file for Windows. You should then be
able to compile the project using your platform's standard build tools.
