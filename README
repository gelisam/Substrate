Substrate 0.1.0
===

Substrate is a GUI tool which makes it easy to build text processing
pipelines.

With its ability to display intermediate results from the middle of your
pipeline, it's easy to spot which part of your pipelines don't behave as they
should.

How to use Substrate
---
Use File/Open to load a Bash script into our plain, Notepad-style text editor.
Don't worry, we don't plan to stay so plain and platform-specific for too long.

Edit away, and when you are curious about the intermediate output of the
current line, hit F5 and Substrate will run the script up to and including the
current line, stripping any trailing pipe character if necessary.
